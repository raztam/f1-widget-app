# 🏎️ F1 Widget App

A lightweight Android app that provides Formula 1 driver standings directly on your home screen — no need to open an app!
This app shows driver scores and championship positions, based on the latest available data, not real-time race updates (yet).

---

## ✨ Features

- 📋 Display current F1 driver standings.
- 🎯 Choose your favorite driver to follow.
- 🧩 Multiple widget types available.
- ⚡ Lightweight and battery-friendly.

---

## 🛠️ Architecture

The app follows a modular clean architecture approach:

- **Data Layer (`data/`)**: Manages local assets and driver data (e.g., reading JSON files).
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic (inside `viewmodels/`).
- **Presentation Layer**: UI elements built with Jetpack Compose (`composables/`, `activities/`, `widgets/`).

It also uses **Dependency Injection** via **Hilt** (`di/` folder).

| `activities/` | Main activities like launcher or settings. |
| `composables/` | Reusable Compose UI components. |
| `data/` | Data sources (e.g., local JSON files with driver information). |

| `ui/theme/` | App theming (colors, typography). |
| `viewmodels/` | ViewModels managing UI-related data. |
| `widgets/` | Homescreen widgets (Driver Standings, etc.). |
